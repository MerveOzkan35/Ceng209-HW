 
"I, Daenerys Stormborn, Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons, 
stand before you today to honor a hero. 
You ventured into the heart of the House of the Undying, faced its dangers, 
and freed my dragons. For your courage, you have earned not only my gratitude, 
but my trust.  

From this moment on, you shall be known as a knight of House Targaryen, 
sworn to protect the realm and serve the cause of the Free.  

May your name echo across the lands, 
and may your loyalty be as unshakable as the dragons you saved."  

*She places the sigil of House Targaryen in your hand, 
her gaze fierce yet filled with respect.*
