This is a game named Dracarys, which is inspired by Game Of Thrones series for my CENG209 System Programming course homework.

# Game Logic
The game is inspired by Game Of Thrones series.
In season 2, a magician from House Of Undying escapes Daenerys Targaryen’s dragons and chaines them in House Of Undying. 
The player’s mission is to save dragons from Pyat Pre and get them to Daenerys, 
Mother of Dragons.

The dungeon game includes 4 rooms and House Of Undying. 
Player starts the game at the Hole of dungeon and should visit each of 4 rooms, beat the  randomly chosen characters in rooms and collect keys. 
If player defeats randomly chosen character from each room, the key of the room is automatically collected and added to keylist of player. 
Without collecting all 4 keys, player can not move to House of Undying. 
And if player successfully collects all keys and also beat the magician Pyat Pre, 
the dragons are automatically saved. A message from Daenerys to player is printed on the screen, player is thanked and gets awarded by Mother Of Dragons.
And at the end, a dragon shape made of ASCII is printed on the screen for a good visual look. 

Note: You need to create a directory named as saves for load/list/save game functions.
