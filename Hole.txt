
The hole is a dark, foreboding space that feels like it has no bottom.
 Its walls are jagged, uneven, and cold to the touch, 
as though carved out by something ancient and merciless. 
The only light comes from faint, glowing runes etched into the stone, 
pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. A constant sound of dripping water echoes eerily, 
adding to the sense of isolation. The air is damp and oppressive, carrying 
a faint metallic tang, as if the hole itself has witnessed countless secrets and bloodshed. 
It feels like a place where hope goes to die, a void that swallows everything.
