
The House of the Undying feels alive with magic as one steps inside. 
The air is heavy, and faint whispers echo through 
twisting corridors lit by flickering blue flames. 
The walls seem to pulse with a sinister energy,
 and each step feels as though the house itself is watching.  

At the heart of the structure lies the Chamber of the Undying,
a circular room glowing with eerie blue light. 
In the center stands a long table surrounded by withered, 
mummified figures draped in decayed robes. 
On the table, three dragons are seen, chained and writhing, 
their cries filling the room with an unsettling mix of power and despair.
Reality bends and blurs, making it impossible to tell what is real and what is illusion.

Pyat Pree stands at the heart of the room, his pale face illuminated by the dim glow.
His dark eyes shine with cunning and power as he watches you closely, 
his lips curling into a knowing smile. The faint smell of incense and ancient rituals 
fills the air, and his presence feels both hypnotic and menacing, 
as if he is always one step ahead, weaving his webs of control.
