
The room exudes strength and rugged grandeur, 
with sturdy wooden furniture and a dominant color palette of black and gold, 
representing House Baratheon. A massive stag's head, their sigil, 
is mounted above a stone fireplace, its antlers sprawling like a crown. 
The walls are adorned with battle banners and weapons,
from war hammers to longswords, hinting at a legacy forged in war. 
The scent of leather and mead fills the air, and the floor is covered with 
a bear-hide rug, reinforcing the image of a house built on might and resilience.
