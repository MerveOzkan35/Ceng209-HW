
The room is a testament to wealth and power, 
dripping in gold and crimson the colors of House Lannister. 
The walls are adorned with intricate tapestries depicting roaring lions, 
their sigil, and great victories of their lineage. 
A massive golden chandelier hangs from the ceiling, 
casting a warm yet oppressive glow over the room. 
Plush chairs with lion shaped armrests surround an ornate table,
and a large fireplace carved with lions heads dominates one wall, 
crackling with a constant, roaring flame. 
The air is thick with the scent of wine and the faintest hint of roses.
